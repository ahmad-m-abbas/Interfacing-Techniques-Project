/***
 * Assumes the maze is already flooded to a single target cell and so
 * every cell will have a cost that decreases as the target is approached.
 *
 * Starting at the given cell, the algorithm repeatedly looks for the
 * smallest available neighbour and records the action taken to reach it.
 *
 * The process starts by assuming the mouse is heading NORTH in the start
 * cell since that is what would be the case at the start of a speed run.
 *
 * At each cell, the preference is to move forwards if possible
 *
 * If the pathfinder is called from any other cell, the mouse must first
 * turn to face to the smallest neighbour of that cell using the same
 * method as in this function.
 *
 * The resulting path is a simple string, null terminated, that can be
 * printed to the console to make it easy to compare paths using different
 * flooding or path generating methods.
 *
 * The characters in the path string are:
 * 	'B' : always the first character, it marks the path start.
 * 	'F' : move forwards a full cell
 * 	'H' : used in speedruns to indicate movement of half a cell forwards
 * 	'R' : turn right in this cell
 * 	'L' : turn left in this cell
 * 	'A' : turn around (should never happen in a speedrun path)
 * 	'S' : the last character in the path, telling the mouse to stop
 *
 * For example, the Japan2007 maze, flooded with a simple Manhattan
 * flood, should produce the path string:
 *
 * BFFFRLLRRLLRRLLRFFRRFLLFFLRFRRLLRRLLRFFFFFFFFFRFFFFFRLRLLRRLLRRFFRFFFLFFFS
 *
 * The path string is processed by the mouse directly to make it move
 * along the path. At its simplest, this is just a case of executing
 * a single movement for each character in the string, using in-place turns.
 *
 * I would strongly recommend this style of path string. Not only can the
 * strings be used to compare routes very easily, they can be printed and
 * visually compared or followed by hand.
 *
 * Path strings are easily translated into more complex paths using
 * smooth turns an they are relatively easy to turn into a set of
 * commands that will represent a diagonal path.
 *
 * Further, short path strings  can be hand-generated to test the movement
 * of the mouse or to test the setup of different turn types.
 *
 * The pathGenerator is not terribly efficient and can take up to 20ms to
 * generate a path depending on the maze, start cell and target.
